Coding:-->
	=> Real development starts from coding phase. During
	   this phase programmers write programs using low
	   level design diagrams...


	   Stage1:-->    Create new Database and create
			 tables according to Database 
			 architecture design diagram..


	   Stage2:-->
			 Prepare core programs at business
			 layer and write API connections to
			 database and front end layer.

	   Stage3:-->
			 Develop user interface and apply
			 business layer and database connections..

Testing:-->
		After  completed coding phase development team
		and testing team perform testing on real software.

		
		Testing Methods:-->

			1. White box testing  [Developer]
			2. Black box testing  [Tester]
			3. Grey box testing   [Developer with testing knowledge]

		
		White box testing:-->
			=> White box testing done by development team.
			   During this test programmer execute programs
			   to verify internal structure of program.
			=> To perform White box testing developer
			    follow below sub tests
				
			1. Unit Testing    
			[Checking every single program]
				
			2. Intergration Testing  
			[Checking integration between related programs]

		 Black box testing:-->
			=> Black box testing done by separate testing
				team [Third party testing team]
			=> During this test tester verify extenal
				functionality of software by operating
				real software at end user level..
			=> To perform black box testing testing team
			   follow below sub tests
			

			3. System Testing
			4. UAT [User acceptance testing]

			=> Black box testing perform at GUI level
				[Graphical User interface]


		   Grey box testing:-->	
			=> Also known as glass box testing
			=> Development team with proper testing
			    training involve here..
			=> Mostly happedn in smaller projects.

Deployment phase:-->

		=> Operational team or Separate devops team
		   involve in deployment phase

		=> Here devops team deploy software from
			development team to testing , testing
			team to production database and from
			prodution database to client servers...

Release and Maintanance:-->.

		=> Once client accepted software. organization
		  plan for release software into live. and
		  also provide further assistance to client..

SDLC models:-->

	Waterfall model
	Incremental model
	spiral model
	prototype model
	RAD [Rapid development model]
	V-Model
	Agile

	Why SDLC models:-->

		=> it aids in Planning,Estimating,Sheduling
		=> it reduce cost of project
		=> it makes stakeholders can view project status
			in every level of development
		=> it decrease risks with in project..
